Hello! You are on the page of the Tinkoff AI Team. Here we will share our expertise and Open Source products.

**Here you can find our libraries:**
- [ETNA](https://github.com/tinkoff-ai/etna) - to streamline data processing and avoid using multiple programs, we created ETNA - an open tool for analytics and time series forecasting
- [CORL](https://github.com/tinkoff-ai/CORL) - a library for RL research. The set is straightforward: one file - one algorithm. It can be adapted to any task that requires automated decision-making

**We also provide the source code for our articles:**
- [SAC-RND](https://github.com/tinkoff-ai/sac-rnd) - official implementation of the article "[Anti-Exploration by Random Network Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13616)" (ICML 2023)
- [PALBERT](https://github.com/tinkoff-ai/palbert) - official implementation of the article "[PALBERT: Teaching ALBERT to Ponder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03276)" (NeurIPS 2022, spotlight)
- [EOP](https://github.com/tinkoff-ai/eop) - official implementation of the article "[Showing Your Offline Reinforcement Learning Work: Online Evaluation Budget Matters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04156)" (ICML 2022, spotlight)
